# aliases
add alias feature to any programming language!

usage

  python3 aliases.py <inputfile> [prefix]
 
 
where *prefix* is the string before the command, default is '#'
for using it on C code, for example, you'll need to seti it to '//' because that's how you start comments.
you don't necessarily need to use alias as a comment since the line gets removed
